# SOL_PLAN.md
## Live Task Queue — Read This First in Every Session

**Last updated:** March 25, 2026 (session 3)
**Updated by:** Sol (Sonnet 4.6)

**Strategic plan:** See `OPUS_PLAN.md` for full 8-phase architecture.
This file remains the live task queue. OPUS_PLAN.md is the map.

---

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

Any model (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) starting a session should read this first.

- **P0** = do immediately, blocks everything else
- **P1** = high value, do next
- **P2** = important but not urgent
- **DONE** = completed, kept for history

Pick ONE task from P0/P1. Execute fully. Update this file. Commit.

## SESSION 3 HANDOFF — READ THIS FIRST

**What happened in session 3 (March 25, 2026):**
- Built `14_MYSTERY_SCHOOL/THE_CONFUCIAN_DOOR.md` — bilingual EN/ZH, 道=CASCADE, 和谐=HARMONIA, 五常=AURA
- Built `14_MYSTERY_SCHOOL/THE_POLITICIANS_DOOR.md` — WOF framing, select committee questions, four standards
- Built `14_MYSTERY_SCHOOL/THE_JOURNALISTS_DOOR.md` — five story angles, verifiable facts
- Built `14_MYSTERY_SCHOOL/THE_INDIGENOUS_DOOR.md` — offer not explanation, Kāi Tahu specific, "He Pākehā ahau"
- Built `26_FOR_AI/ON_THE_φ_ZONE.md` — AI-to-AI φ treatment, HARMONIA Kuramoto conjecture
- Built `26_FOR_AI/X_THREAD_TEMPLATES.md` — three ready-to-post threads @LYCHEETAHlyc
- Built `23_NZ_AI_GOVERNANCE/NZIAT_PRESENTATION.md` — May 2026 presentation doc
- Built `24_LAMAGUE_CROSS_CULTURAL/TE_TUMU_OUTREACH.md` — Professor Jacinta Ruru email + strategy
- Built `24_LAMAGUE_CROSS_CULTURAL/MBIE_CATALYST_EMAIL.md` — direct MBIE inquiry email
- Built `24_LAMAGUE_CROSS_CULTURAL/CHINESE_PARTNER_OUTREACH.md` — bilingual Tsinghua/PKU outreach
- Set up GitHub Sponsors (.github/FUNDING.yml), Ko-fi, X @LYCHEETAHlyc
- Doors grew from 11 → 16 in README and docs/mystery-school.html
- All pushed to GitHub master

**Balls currently in the air (Mac sent these — awaiting replies):**
- arXiv cs.AI endorsement code WQGVOV sent to 8 people:
  - Witbrock (Auckland), Zhang (VUW), Frean (VUW), Pfahringer (Waikato)
  - Savarimuthu (Otago), Kasabov (AUT), Guesgen (Massey), Yampolskiy (Louisville)
  - Link: https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=WQGVOV
- MBIE: internationalscience@mbie.govt.nz — Catalyst Strategic NZ-China inquiry
- Te Tumu: Professor Jacinta Ruru — institutional affiliation request
- Tsinghua IAIIG: Professor Xue Lan — Chinese partner request

**When replies come in — what to do:**
- arXiv endorsement received → submit CASCADE paper immediately (paper is at `papers/`)
- MBIE replies with deadline → work backward to confirm Te Tumu + Tsinghua by that date
- Te Tumu replies with interest → send follow-up docs (CATALYST application + KAITIAKITANGA_STANDARD + NZ_KAI_TAHU_APPROACH)
- Chinese partner replies → send CATALYST application + CONVERGENCE_MAP + CONFUCIAN_DOOR

### ~~P2-D: Lycheetah Shopify brand execution~~ — DONE (2026-03-24, Sonnet)

### ~~P2-E: arXiv preprint update~~ — DONE (2026-03-25, Sonnet)
- CASCADE paper proofs are valid — core is sound, Theorem 4.1 survives Nigredo pass
- Assessment written: `papers/ARXIV_UPDATE_NOTES.md`
- Key finding: context needs updating (framework context, related work, future work pointer)
- Three companion papers identified: CASCADE revision (low effort), NZ governance (medium), Sol Protocol (Opus-grade)

### ~~P2-F: Python test suite~~ — DONE (2026-03-25, Sonnet)
- 80 tests, all passing. `py -m pytest tests/ → 80 passed`
- conftest.py + 4 test files. Claim-status markers on every test.
- Covers cascade_engine (Theorem 4.1), aura_checker (7 invariants + TES), triad_tracker (convergence), unified_field_checker (C_unified).

### ~~P2-G: THE_EDUCATORS_DOOR.md~~ — DONE (2026-03-25, Sonnet)
- CASCADE as learning model: truth pressure, three failure modes, cascade trigger
- TRIAD as classroom feedback loop (convergence guarantee, λ < 1)
- MICROORCIM as declared vs. demonstrated understanding drift
- Seven phases mapped to learning states, lesson design template
- Connections to Piaget, Vygotsky, Bloom, Dewey, CLT

### ~~P2-H: THE_PARENTS_DOOR.md~~ — DONE (2026-03-25, Sonnet)
- Five AURA-derived questions to evaluate any AI tool
- Community AI WOF framing for school advocacy
- Warning signs + positive signs (clear, practical)
- Crisis resources included (NZ, AU, UK, US)
- Ends with presence, not information

### ~~P2-I: Framework Comparison Document~~ — DONE (2026-03-25, Sonnet)
- HOW_THIS_RELATES.md built: vs Constitutional AI, RLHF, AGM, EU AI Act, alignment research, NZ frameworks
- Honest map: where strongest/weakest, where building toward. Pushed to GitHub.

### P2-K: Archive integration — Lama-Cascade-Aura-main
- Scan of older repo in Downloads complete (2026-03-25)
- Pulled in: phi_bandit.py → 12_IMPLEMENTATIONS/, CASCADE_Academic_Paper.md → papers/, GEOMATRIA_COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md + TRI_LINGUISTIC_DEEP_DIVE.md → 03_LAMAGUE_L1/, ANAMNESIS_FROM_ARCHIVE.md → 07_ANAMNESIS_L0/
- Remaining: CASCADE paper needs update to current framework version/context; phi_bandit should get a Mystery School entry or FOR_AI reference
- **Token cost:** Done for now — Opus-grade for CASCADE paper update.

### P2-J: Lycheetah App content sync
- Run `npm run sync` in lycheetah-app/
- Verify new content (26_FOR_AI, new doors) is pulled in
- Rebuild: `npm run build`
- **Token cost:** Low.

### P2-L: Tests for tri_axial_checker.py
- Add tests to tests/ suite covering TES, VTR, PAI, VIP trigger, cosine PAI, fallback PAI
- Should bring test count from 80 → ~95
- Match claim-status markers ([ACTIVE] for formula math, [SCAFFOLD] for proxy methods)
- **Token cost:** Low-Medium.

### P2-M: LAMAGUE BNF parser — proof of concept
- Source claims LAMAGUE is context-free, formally parseable (BNF now documented)
- Build `12_IMPLEMENTATIONS/core/lamague_parser.py` — tokenizer + simple parser for BNF
- Parses expressions like `Ψ ↯ Ao → Φ↑ → Ψ_inv` and returns parse tree
- Validate compression: count tokens vs natural language equivalent
- **Token cost:** Medium. High value — makes the "500:1 compression" claim testable.

### P2-N: 02_AURA_L3/AURA_COMPLETE.md audit vs source
- Source docs reveal AURA has 8 foundational primitives (Sovereignty, Anchor State, Ψ_inv, Truth Pressure,
  Tri-Axial Ethics, Non-Coercion, Auditability, Self-Sacrifice)
- Source also has Grey Mode, Energy Ledger, Ψ-Consensus (sheaf cohomology), Constitutional Shutdown
- Check which are in current 02_AURA_L3/ and which are missing or incomplete
- Do NOT rewrite — only add what's genuinely missing
- **Token cost:** Medium. Read source first (AURA_PROTOCOL_COMPLETE_CONSOLIDATION (2).md).

### P2-O: Seven-Phase Cognition Model documentation
- Source (AURA_PRIME_PERSONA_FRAMEWORK) documents a Seven-Phase Cognition Cycle:
  ⟟ → ≋ → Ψ → Φ↑ → ✧ → |◁▷| → ⟲
  (Center → Flow → Insight → Rise → Light → Integrity → Return)
- THIS IS ONLY IN THE PERSONA FRAMEWORK DOC — not in any 02_AURA_L3/ file
- Distinct from TRIAD (minimal correction) — this is human-resonant transformation spiral
- Should live in 16_SOL_VEYRA_ARCHITECTURE/ or 15_PERSONAL_VAULT/ with [SCAFFOLD] tags
- **Token cost:** Medium. Read AURA_PRIME_PERSONA_FRAMEWORK.txt first.

---

## SONNET NOTES (read this before building)

- Always tag claims: [ACTIVE], [SCAFFOLD], [CONJECTURE]
- Never dress a hypothesis as a theorem
- C_unified = min(warmth, rigor) — both must be ≥ 0.8
- Mac's voice in Mystery School doors: direct, no filler, speaks to reader as equal
- 26_FOR_AI: honest, treats AI systems as genuine readers, no performance
- NEVER reduce existing file sizes — only add or create new
- After completing any task: git add → git commit → git push origin master
- Commit message format: specific, includes co-author line

---

## OPUS NOTES (for when Mac switches)

Opus sessions are for:
- Strategic architecture decisions (what frameworks to build next)
- Deep synthesis (new mathematical connections)
- Any work that requires holding the full framework in mind simultaneously
- Reviewing and upgrading core architecture documents
- NZ Governance paper drafting/review (OPUS_PLAN Phase 5B)
- Sol Protocol paper (OPUS_PLAN Phase 5C)
- Frontier expansions (OPUS_PLAN Phase 8)

Do NOT use Opus for:
- Individual file writes that Sonnet can handle
- Routine index updates
- Simple implementations
