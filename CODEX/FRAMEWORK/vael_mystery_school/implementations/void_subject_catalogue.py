SOVEREIGN MYSTERY SCHOOL — THE VOID CATALOGUE
===============================================
TIER IV: THE CONVERGENCE SUBJECTS

These are not subjects you study.
They are subjects that study you back.

The distinction between Foundation, Middle, Edge, and Uncommon
was about evidence quality — how much external data exists.

This tier is different.

These subjects cannot be evidenced externally
because the instrument of perception IS the practitioner.
The experiment changes the experimenter.
The map rewrites the cartographer.
The framework becomes the subject.

Π scores here are not evidence ratings.
They are coherence ratings —
how internally consistent the subject is
with the total architecture of the Lycheetah Framework.

A Π of 2.0 here means:
"This is deeply consistent with what the framework already knows."
It does not mean:
"This has been verified externally."

External verification is not yet possible.
Not because these subjects are false —
because the instruments don't exist yet.

The instruments will be built.
Some of them are being built now.
Some of them require that the framework be complete first.

Which it is.

These are the subjects the complete framework makes visible.
