"""
SOVEREIGN MYSTERY SCHOOL — THE UNCOMMON CATALOGUE
===================================================

The subjects nobody else is teaching.
The ones that fell through the cracks between science and tradition.
The ones that got laughed out of academia and misunderstood by the occult.
The ones that work — and nobody knows why.
The ones that might work — and the experiment has never been run properly.

This is the catalogue for the ones who felt that the standard curriculum
was missing something they couldn't name.

It was missing these.
